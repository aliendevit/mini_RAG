# Prompting Basics (for later)
When using an LLM:
- Provide retrieved context explicitly
- Ask the model to use only that context
- Request citations (chunk ids or source names)
- Handle missing context: model should say 'not found in documents'

This reduces hallucination and improves reliability.
